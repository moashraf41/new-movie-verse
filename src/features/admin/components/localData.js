          "Directed by Jake Schreier (Netflix’s Beef, Showtime’s Kidding) and written by Eric Pearson (Transformers One, Black Widow) and Joanna Calo (The Bear, Bojack Horseman), Thunderbolts* documents the emptiness surrounding Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh) as she goes through the motions while working for the Ox Group led by Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus).\r\n\r\nYelena still hasn’t recovered from Natasha/Black Widow’s death and is sick of killing people and doing villainous tasks for money. After a visit with her father figure Alexai Shostakov (David Harbour), Yelena decides to go straight and attempt to be a hero.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for her, de Fontaine is currently being investigated by the government and is on the verge of being impeached. Yelena’s last job is just an excuse for de Fontaine to tie up all her loose ends and appear innocent. Yelena finds herself trapped in a giant incinerator with U.S. Agent (Wyatt Russell), Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen), Taskmaster (Olga Kurylenko), and a man plagued with memory loss named Bob (Lewis Pullman).\r\n\r\nThunderbolts* is a strange superhero film for a variety of reasons. The antihero dynamic already gives the film a dysfunctional Guardians of the Galaxy/Suicide Squad appeal, where a bunch of outcasts find refuge and redemption by working together as a team. But the film’s writing is interesting because Thunderbolts* doesn’t feature traditional character development. What these characters share is loss.\r\n\r\nIn a reveal that is likely not difficult to figure out, there’s more to Bob than Thunderbolts* lets on. Without fully spoiling the direction the film goes in with the character, Bob is able to see someone’s memories with physical touch. While this results in some interesting reveals from certain character’s pasts, it never really gets too deep even when Bob decides to share a bit more about what he’s gone through.\r\n\r\nWith Bob’s ability to enter people’s minds at will, the finale of Thunderbolts* has an Inception kind of element to it, but is more of a battle with inner demons than it is an all out CGI slugfest. The Thunderbolts* crash through dream barriers that alter physics while transitioning to whichever character is taking the lead in the sequence (the film typically goes back and forth between Yelena and Bob).\r\n\r\nBut the uniting of these characters still rides on trauma and loss. Yelena is searching for something to fill the emptiness inside of her. Alexei hasn’t been Red Guardian since the events of Black Widow and now drives a red limo for a job. He has completely lost whatever remained of his already dwindling super-soldier status.\r\n\r\nGhost no longer struggles to control her powers or her molecular status, but she does struggle with finding a purpose in this film. Apart from fighting and bickering with everyone, Ghost doesn’t add much to the film.\r\n\r\nU.S. Agent is in denial about no longer being Captain America. He acts like he has everything going for him, but has initially lost everything after the events of Falcon and the Winter Soldier. Valentina Allegra de Fontaine is on the verge of losing everything she’s been trying to build. Bob has always been alone. He’s never had friends and the void that has left inside him is quite literally a plot device for later in the film.\r\n\r\nBucky (Sebastian Stan) has been dabbling in Congress, but he’s kind of floundered around since Sam Wilson became the new Captain America. He’s not so secretly a part of the de Fontaine impeachment investigation and is searching for some sort of concrete evidence the only way The Winter Soldier can.\r\n\r\nThe film’s entertainment value is mostly invested in how unlikely this group of outcasts and shoehorned “heroes” are when they’re all trapped together in the same building. They initially start off being too stubborn to work together and it’s only once they learn how flawed the other costumed individuals are around them do they start to actually make a decent team.\r\n\r\nThere isn’t a ton of depth to Thunderbolts*, but it’s fun for what it is and is much more enjoyable than Captain America: Brave New World. The film is mostly setting up a new Avengers-like team for the next phase of the MCU although Sam Wilson’s Captain America is doing something similar. The film is purely worth seeing for Bob. The character has serious potential and Lewis Pullman has a clueless charm in his performance that coincides with one of the most powerful characters in the MCU.\r\n\r\nThunderbolts* is loaded with ass-kicking awesomeness. Florence Pugh is outstanding and Bob is the coolest character to come along in the MCU in a long, long time. Antiheroes are finally fun again.",

          "FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://movieswetextedabout.com/thunderbolts-movie-review-a-refreshing-character-driven-detour-from-multiversal-chaos/\r\n\r\n\"Thunderbolts* is an exceptional superhero movie precisely because it focuses on a deep exploration of human fragility. Prioritizing its broken protagonists' internal struggles over pure audiovisual spectacle shows a rare maturity in a franchise often criticized for sacrificing substance in favor of generic scale.\r\n\r\nThis bold approach allows the cast to shine - Florence Pugh especially, who firmly establishes herself as one of the MCU's core pillars. By exploring themes like depression, grief, abandonment, and reconnection with honesty and care, Jake Schreier transforms a blockbuster into a poignant meditation on shared purpose and what it means to live with open wounds.\r\n\r\nIn a landscape flooded with recycled formulas, Marvel has delivered something courageously human - making this Phase Five closing piece not only one of the year's biggest surprises but also one of the most emotionally resonant entries in the entire cinematic universe.\"\r\n\r\nRating: A",

          'Superheroes are supposed to be special, gifted individuals, so it logically follows that movies about them should be equally special. However, as has become all too apparent in recent years, that quality has been steadily eroding in these films due to oversaturation in the cinematic marketplace, a circumstance that naturally begs the question, how special (i.e., how different or distinguished) can they really be when there are so many of them? Sadly, that\'s the key issue weighing down this latest release in the Marvel Universe. Even though the film serves as an introduction to a new slate of Marvel superheroes, the picture isn\'t particularly groundbreaking given the many similar offerings that have preceded it in this genre. Despite this film\'s few minor modifications to an otherwise-formulaic and shopworn narrative, in many respects, the picture\'s story feels like it\'s been cobbled together from elements in other superhero adventures. For instance, the band of heroes here consists largely of a collection of courageous misfits reminiscent of releases in the "Suicide Squad" franchise. Then there are the nerdy sidekicks, who feel like they\'ve been culled from the "Deadpool" pictures. And the primary challenge these characters face comes from the threat of dubious weaponized technology wielded by a power-hungry leader, a scenario at the heart of films like "X-men: Days of Future Past" (2014) and "Logan" (2017). This patchwork of elements consequently makes for a plotline that frequently feels forced and somewhat disjointed yet also ultimately predictable. Its few departures from the tried and true, while modestly interesting, feel as though they\'ve been included to silence critics as supposed evidence of the production\'s efforts to incorporate fresh new material. To its credit, "Thunderbolts*" features some genuinely funny comic relief and commendable performances by Florence Pugh, Sebastian Stan and Julia Louis-Dreyfus, though the action sequences come across as a little stale and the unimpressive CGI effects could use some shoring up. Director Jake Schreier does a capable job of doing what this film was essentially designed to do - give diehard Marvel fans another fix of what they truly crave. And that\'s fine as far as it goes. But, in terms of its contributions to the annals of filmdom, this is far from memorable filmmaking, especially in terms of originality. After all, cookie cutters are supposed to be used for making baked goods, not movies.',

          "Hats off to Florence Pugh for injecting some charisma into this film, but otherwise I found it to be little different from the latest slew of “save the planet” Marvel adventures that follows a predictable pattern of escaping from the frying pan into the fire a few times before it culminates in a proud declaration that a new franchise has been born. It turns out that “Yelena” (Pugh) has been working for years as an assassin for the “Val” (Julia-Louise Dreyfus) whose director of the CIA seems to have been running unfettered off-the-books projects around the globe trying to impose her own brand of world order. The US Congress is breathing down her neck, now, though - so it is time to eliminate all the loose ends. Of course, that doesn’t quite go to plan and instead of disposing of the incriminating evidence, she merely galvanises an unlikely team of erstwhile employees of the agency to wreak their own vengeance. Meantime, the former “Winter Soldier” has got himself elected to the House and is now determined to work with those impeaching “Val” to bring her to book. Looks like “Buckie” (Sebastian Stan) might have to join this disparate group as it becomes clear that one of their number, the unassuming and pyjama-clad “Bob” (Lewis Pullman) might have more in common with “Brightburn” than “Superman”. What now ensues is the usual team-building exercise as they learn to trust each other, reveal secrets from their typically troubled pasts and, of course, kick some ass. David Harbour enthusiastically delivers his “Red Guardian” character, as does the very slightly menacing Pugh, but the others in the gang are all instantly forgettable and though ostensibly darker than many of its contemporaries, it still suffers from the perennial problem facing the whole MCU: they tee up these baddies with overwhelming psychological and physical prowess and yet you always know there will be sunlit uplands at the end. Stick around til the very end of the credits, though, for perhaps the most poignant part of this film. It is, after all, all about who sells the brand.",

          "<em>'A Working Man'</em> is imperfectly very good. I do have a couple of issues with it, but all in all I have to say that I did enjoy this to a fairly strong degree. Jason Statham seldom disappoints in an action thriller, I'm a fan of his so was always likely to get the required fun out of this.\r\n\r\nStatham is great, naturally without him the movie would be vastly less entertaining. Away from the former British diver (still can't quite believe that's the same guy!), there are too many characters - which is one of the issues I have. There didn't need to be so many peeps in this.\r\n\r\nEven so, those onscreen are all decent enough and none register as overt negatives in my mind. David Harbour does well in a small role, he usually speaks the same way in roles but this feels minorly different. Michael Peña and Arianna Rivas are solid, as is Jason Flemyng.\r\n\r\nThe latter's character should've be the only bad guy in this, or at least one of a few. He gives enough that we didn't need anyone else in my opinion, especially as 'higher-ups' Andrej Kaminsky and Maximilian Osinski give weaker performances. Chidi Ajufo is the best of the rest.\r\n\r\nMy other issue lies with the run time. I guess with so many characters it did need to be almost two hours in length, however you could've told this story within 90 minutes without a doubt. But again, as noticeable as that and the other issue is, it at least doesn't hinder much for me.",

          '"A working Man" is an accidental satire, of the US action film genre.\r\n\r\nWorking class guy, who served in the military and now works for a migrant families construction company, looks to save their angelic daughter, the vision of perfection, from the evil Russian human traffickers. \r\n\r\nEverything is an exaggeration. From the notion of the working class guy, a rough diamond, a patriot,  with a heart of gold. The migrant family with the dutiful, over achiever on steroids daughter, the true inheritors of the American dream. Even, the minimum wage construction workers, who are told to make sure they "keep their fingers" (you can see occupational health and safety is a big thing) are so happy they look like they belong in the original production of "Snow White" (the real one, not the hideous remake). As for the Russians, well surprise, surprise, they are brutal, cruel and stupid. No one saw that coming, right?\r\n\r\nI won\'t mix words, this is cliched, biased, condescending, pro Western military, jingoistic, crap. Interesting too, how venture capitalists "State Street" make a brief appearance, in the opening credits. If they thought this would lift their profile, well all I can say is it didn\'t "do it, for me". Sorry guys. \r\n\r\nIs there an upside? In short no. Even the action has a ham fisted, "seen it all before", air of stale, stagnation, about it. \r\n\r\nIn summary, a horrible facsimile of superior action films, you have probably seen before. Loaded down with trite cliches, stereotypes and jarring biases. One to avoid.',

          "On paper, director David Ayer‘s revenge action thriller “A Working Man” should be a slam dunk for Jason Statham. Based on Chuck Dixon’s novel “Levon’s Trade,” it has all the familiar elements that not only cater to the actor’s strengths, but also to the desires of his most die hard fans. Unfortunately, very little about the film works, and it comes across as dull, predictable, and unmemorable.\r\n\r\nLevon (Statham) is a former black ops solider turned construction worker who is forced to return to his lethal past when his boss’s daughter (Arianna Rivas) is abducted by human traffickers. What starts as a rescue mission soon unravels a deeper web of corruption, pushing Levon to do what he does best: take down bad guys with ruthless efficiency.\r\n\r\nThe premise is well-worn but serviceable, but never quite rises above its own mediocrity. The stunt work is strong and the fights are bloody, but the action sequences mostly lack the punch and creativity needed to garner any feelings of excitement. The action is middling, which makes the uninspired story stand out in the worst way.\r\n\r\nEven worse, the film lacks personality. It’s competently made but painfully generic, with a by-the-numbers plot that fails to generate any real emotional stakes. The script (co-written by Ayer and Sylvester Stallone) doesn’t do enough to elevate the material beyond standard action fare.\r\n\r\nDespite being well cast, the film wastes a terrific supporting turn from David Harbour, and it feels like the reliable tough guy Statham is running on autopilot. Nobody enjoys watching a movie where the lead actor is delivering a performance that feels more like a contractual obligation than a passion project.\r\n\r\nWorking in harmony with Ayer’s directorial style, Shawn White’s cinematography proves to be the brightest spot. This is a polished, good looking action thriller, at least visually speaking.\r\n\r\nIf I had to sum up “A Working Man” in one word, it would be “serviceable.” This is a film that will be buried under Statham’s long list of similar (and much better) movies.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

          "Well if you just thought Jason Statham was going to make a movie about the dangers of the construction industry then the first few scenes will put you straight and give a clue that his past is altogether more violent. That is going to come in handy when the daughter of his boss is kidnapped-to-order by some people traffickers and he is, initially reluctantly, drafted into track her down. With consummate ease, he sets about his task facing down some of the menacing Russian brotherhood who rule the roost supplying girls, drugs and booze to whoever can afford to pay! Can he find the girl? Will the sun come up? There’s not the slightest hint of jeopardy to any of this derivative outing for a star whose usual charisma has been left in his Winnebago. It’s got bits of “Die Hard” (1988) mixed in with, I thought, that Clint Eastwood “Cry Macho” (2021) affair plus the seriously camped up pairing of Jason Flemyng and Maximilian Osinski to make sure that any scintilla of credibility was well and truly throttled after about fifteen minutes of this repetitive and predictable drama. Sylvester Stallone had an hand in the writing - I suppose someone had to put the full stops in the script, and David Ayer shows little, is any, flair as the thing lumbers along for what seems like a lot longer than two hours. Let’s hope Jace isn’t going down the Bruce Willis boulevard of broken dreams here, and doesn’t make any more duds like this.",

          "Alright, buckle up, because I just saw a movie that completely blew my mind! Seriously, I'm still buzzing. From the very first scene, I was absolutely hooked, and it didn't let go until the credits rolled.\r\n\r\nThe story? Oh my gosh, the story! It was so clever and well-crafted. It had twists and turns I never saw coming, but it all made perfect sense in the end. It was like a puzzle that slowly came together, and every piece was perfectly placed. You know when a movie makes you think? This one definitely did that. It wasn't just mindless action or fluff; it had real substance.\r\n\r\nAnd the characters! They were so real and relatable. I felt like I knew them, like I was right there with them on their journey. They had depth, they had flaws, they had moments that made me laugh, and moments that made me want to cry. I was completely invested in what happened to them. The actors did an amazing job bringing them to life. You could feel their emotions through the screen.\r\n\r\nVisually, it was stunning. The way it was shot, the colors, the sets – everything was just beautiful. It wasn't just pretty to look at, though; it also added to the story and the mood. Some scenes were so powerful, they'll stay with me for a long time. The music was also perfect! It really enhanced the emotions and made everything even more impactful.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I can't think of a single thing I didn't like about this movie. It had everything: a great story, amazing characters, beautiful visuals, and a fantastic soundtrack. It made me feel so many different things, and it left me thinking long after it was over. If you're looking for a movie that will take you on a journey and leave you completely satisfied, this is it. Trust me, you won't be disappointed! It's a 10/10 masterpiece in my book!",

          "Who doesn’t like a white woolly llama? Well that’s probably the highlight of this derivative CGI-fest that finds a quartet of geeks and gamers dragged through a magical portal to a world ruled by the evil “Malgosha”. Now she wants to use this glowing cube to escape from her dark and dingy “Overworld” realm and take over the peaceable and colourful real-world but she hasn’t banked on the tenacity of former gaming champion “Garrett” (Jason Momoa) and the geeky “Henry” (Sebastian Hansen) who reunite with the long trapped “Steve” (Jack Black) to save the day and the world. You don’t really need to know much about the video game to appreciate the simplicity of this, but then again I’m note sure you’d need to be much over 5 to appreciate it either. The visuals are engagingly 1980s with some references that did remind me a bit of “Back to the Future” (1985) meets “Dungeons & Dragons” and a decent soundtrack that allows Black to get straight into his element and prove that it is possible to entertain amidst what was undoubtedly (for him) a sea of green! Momoa isn’t afraid to send himself up both Danielle Brooks and Sebastian Henry seem to be ready to immerse themselves in this once in a lifetime opportunity to be in a big-budget movie without really having any lines to learn, cues to make or long sessions in the make up chair. As ever with these weakly written fantasies, the denouement is never in jeopardy but with so much enthusiasm on the screen for something that was, for many, an integral part of their growing up it’s difficult to be overly critical of something so shamelessly sentimental. What it isn’t, though, is funny and the laughs are few and far between so I think it’s best to just aim low and let the whole tide of your adolescence (if you are old enough) to wash over you before you leave the cinema, completely forget all about this and hope there isn’t a sequel.",
